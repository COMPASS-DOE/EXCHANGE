## About EXCHANGE
The Exploration of Coastal Hydrobiogeochemistry Across a Network of Gradients and Experiments (EXCHANGE) program is a consortium of scientists that aims to improve understanding of how the two-way exchange of water between estuaries or large lake lacustuaries and the terrestrial landscape influence the state and function of ecosystems across the coastal interface. This consortium emphasizes community-driven open science.

## Overarching Hypothesis
There is a hierarchical structure to spatial variation in ecosystem structure and function at the coastal TAI that is set first by the **depth and duration of soil saturation** (a function of elevation and coastal water exposure), second by the **abundance of redox-sensitive elements**, and third by their **interactions with plant traits** which vary along transverse, river-estuary, alongshore, and geomorphic gradients.


Sub-Hypotheses Intent:
1. Vascular plant-derived organic matter stability across gradients under “baseline” conditions (EXCHANGE Campaign 1 (EC1))
2. Rapid Hydrological Events (e.g. Floods) (EXCHANGE Campaign 2 (EC2))
3. Water soluble organic matter experiments across gradients (EXCHANGE Campaign 3 (EC3 or EC1 archives))

_EXCHANGE is a sub-activity of the DOE-BER funded Coastal Observations, Mechanisms, and Predictions Across Systems and Scales - Field Measurements and Experiments ([COMPASS-FME](https://compass.pnnl.gov/FME/COMPASSFME)) project. COMPASS-FME  is a multi-institutional effort led by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) with a decadal vision to dramatically enhance predictive understanding of coastal systems, including their response to short- and long-term changes._
